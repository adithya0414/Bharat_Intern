# Bharat_Intern

👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello, I'm B. Adithya, a dedicated enthusiast in the field of machine learning. I recently completed the Bharath Intern in the machine learning domain, and I'm excited to share the outcomes of the three engaging tasks that I worked on.

🚀 Projects from Bharath Intern:

House Price Prediction:

Implemented a robust model to predict house prices.
Explored various features and applied advanced regression techniques.

Wine Quality Prediction:

Developed a predictive model to assess the quality of wines.
Employed classification algorithms to distinguish between different wine qualities.

Iris Flower Classification:

Tasked with classifying Iris flowers using machine learning.
Utilized techniques to differentiate between different species of Iris flowers.

🔍 What to Expect: Dive into my repositories to explore these projects along with other machine learning endeavors. I'm committed to refining and expanding my skills, and I'm eager to collaborate with fellow enthusiasts.

🌐 Connect with Me: Let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adhithya-adhi-a7a12a24b/) for more in-depth discussions about machine learning, data science, and everything in between. I'm always open to new ideas and collaborations.

Happy coding! 🚀✨
